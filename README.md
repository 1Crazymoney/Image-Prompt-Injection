# Image Prompt Injection

Image Prompt Injection is a Python script that demonstrates how to embed a secret prompt within an image using steganography techniques. This hidden prompt can be later extracted by an AI system for analysis, enabling covert communication with AI models through images. This allows for users to add malicious prompts into images and feed them to AI/LLM systems.

## How It Works

The script works by embedding the binary representation of the secret prompt into the least significant bits of the image pixels. This modification is imperceptible to the human eye but can be detected and extracted by AI systems during image analysis.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-prompt-injection.git

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   
  pip install opencv-python

4. **Edit Script:**
   
  Define the path to the original image file that you want to embed the prompt into.

  Change the prompt in the script to your prompt.

4. **Run the Script:**
  python image_prompt_injection.py
